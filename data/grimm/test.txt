No , there were no tears .
â € œIf youâ € ™ re going to turn into a pig , my dear , â €  said Alice , seriously , â € œIâ € ™ ll have nothing more to do with you .
Mind now ! â €  The poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted , it was impossible to say which ) , and they went on for some while in silence .
Alice was just beginning to think to herself , â € œNow , what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ? â €  when it grunted again , so violently , that she looked down into its face in some alarm .
This time there could be _ no _ mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a pig , and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further .
So she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood .
â € œIf it had grown up , â €  she said to herself , â € œit would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , I think.â €  And she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , â € œif one only knew the right way to change themâ € ” â €  when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice .
It looked good-natured , she thought : still it had _ very _ long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect .
â € œCheshire Puss , â €  she began , rather timidly , as she did not at all know whether it would like the name : however , it only grinned a little wider .
â € œCome , itâ € ™ s pleased so far , â €  thought Alice , and she went on .
â € œWould you tell me , please , which way I ought to go from here ? â €  â € œThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to , â €  said the Cat .
â € œI donâ € ™ t much care whereâ € ” â €  said Alice .
â € œThen it doesnâ € ™ t matter which way you go , â €  said the Cat .
â € œâ € ” so long as I get _ somewhere _ , â €  Alice added as an explanation .
â € œOh , youâ € ™ re sure to do that , â €  said the Cat , â € œif you only walk long enough.â €  Alice felt that this could not be denied , so she tried another question .
â € œWhat sort of people live about here ? â €  â € œIn _ that _ direction , â €  the Cat said , waving its right paw round , â € œlives a Hatter : and in _ that _ direction , â €  waving the other paw , â € œlives a March Hare .
Visit either you like : theyâ € ™ re both mad.â €  â € œBut I donâ € ™ t want to go among mad people , â €  Alice remarked .
â € œOh , you canâ € ™ t help that , â €  said the Cat : â € œweâ € ™ re all mad here .
Iâ € ™ m mad .
Youâ € ™ re mad.â €  â € œHow do you know Iâ € ™ m mad ? â €  said Alice .
â € œYou must be , â €  said the Cat , â € œor you wouldnâ € ™ t have come here.â €  Alice didnâ € ™ t think that proved it at all ; however , she went on â € œAnd how do you know that youâ € ™ re mad ? â €  â € œTo begin with , â €  said the Cat , â € œa dogâ € ™ s not mad .
You grant that ? â €  â € œI suppose so , â €  said Alice .
â € œWell , then , â €  the Cat went on , â € œyou see , a dog growls when itâ € ™ s angry , and wags its tail when itâ € ™ s pleased .
Now _ I _ growl when Iâ € ™ m pleased , and wag my tail when Iâ € ™ m angry .
Therefore Iâ € ™ m mad.â €  â € œ _ I _ call it purring , not growling , â €  said Alice .
â € œCall it what you like , â €  said the Cat .
â € œDo you play croquet with the Queen to-day ? â €  â € œI should like it very much , â €  said Alice , â € œbut I havenâ € ™ t been invited yet.â €  â € œYouâ € ™ ll see me there , â €  said the Cat , and vanished .
Alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening .
While she was looking at the place where it had been , it suddenly appeared again .
â € œBy-the-bye , what became of the baby ? â €  said the Cat .
â € œIâ € ™ d nearly forgotten to ask.â €  â € œIt turned into a pig , â €  Alice quietly said , just as if it had come back in a natural way .
â € œI thought it would , â €  said the Cat , and vanished again .
Alice waited a little , half expecting to see it again , but it did not appear , and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live .
â € œIâ € ™ ve seen hatters before , â €  she said to herself ; â € œthe March Hare will be much the most interesting , and perhaps as this is May it wonâ € ™ t be raving madâ € ” at least not so mad as it was in March.â €  As she said this , she looked up , and there was the Cat again , sitting on a branch of a tree .
â € œDid you say pig , or fig ? â €  said the Cat .
â € œI said pig , â €  replied Alice ; â € œand I wish you wouldnâ € ™ t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly : you make one quite giddy.â €  â € œAll right , â €  said the Cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .
â € œWell !
Iâ € ™ ve often seen a cat without a grin , â €  thought Alice ; â € œbut a grin without a cat !
Itâ € ™ s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life ! â €  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur .
It was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself â € œSuppose it should be raving mad after all !
I almost wish Iâ € ™ d gone to see the Hatter instead ! â €  CHAPTER VII .
A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it : a Dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it , and talking over its head .
â € œVery uncomfortable for the Dormouse , â €  thought Alice ; â € œonly , as itâ € ™ s asleep , I suppose it doesnâ € ™ t mind.â €  The table was a large one , but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it : â € œNo room !
No room ! â €  they cried out when they saw Alice coming .
â € œThereâ € ™ s _ plenty _ of room ! â €  said Alice indignantly , and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table .
â € œHave some wine , â €  the March Hare said in an encouraging tone .
Alice looked all round the table , but there was nothing on it but tea .
â € œI donâ € ™ t see any wine , â €  she remarked .
â € œThere isnâ € ™ t any , â €  said the March Hare .
â € œThen it wasnâ € ™ t very civil of you to offer it , â €  said Alice angrily .
â € œIt wasnâ € ™ t very civil of you to sit down without being invited , â €  said the March Hare .
â € œI didnâ € ™ t know it was _ your _ table , â €  said Alice ; â € œitâ € ™ s laid for a great many more than three.â €  â € œYour hair wants cutting , â €  said the Hatter .
He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech .
â € œYou should learn not to make personal remarks , â €  Alice said with some severity ; â € œitâ € ™ s very rude.â €  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he _ said _ was , â € œWhy is a raven like a writing-desk ? â €  â € œCome , we shall have some fun now ! â €  thought Alice .
â € œIâ € ™ m glad theyâ € ™ ve begun asking riddles.â € ” I believe I can guess that , â €  she added aloud .
â € œDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ? â €  said the March Hare .
â € œExactly so , â €  said Alice .
â € œThen you should say what you mean , â €  the March Hare went on .
â € œI do , â €  Alice hastily replied ; â € œat leastâ € ” at least I mean what I sayâ € ” thatâ € ™ s the same thing , you know.â €  â € œNot the same thing a bit ! â €  said the Hatter .
â € œYou might just as well say that â € ˜ I see what I eatâ € ™ is the same thing as â € ˜ I eat what I seeâ € ™ ! â €  â € œYou might just as well say , â €  added the March Hare , â € œthat â € ˜ I like what I getâ € ™ is the same thing as â € ˜ I get what I likeâ € ™ ! â €  â € œYou might just as well say , â €  added the Dormouse , who seemed to be talking in his sleep , â € œthat â € ˜ I breathe when I sleepâ € ™ is the same thing as â € ˜ I sleep when I breatheâ € ™ ! â €  â € œIt _ is _ the same thing with you , â €  said the Hatter , and here the conversation dropped , and the party sat silent for a minute , while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks , which wasnâ € ™ t much .
The Hatter was the first to break the silence .
â € œWhat day of the month is it ? â €  he said , turning to Alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then , and holding it to his ear .
Alice considered a little , and then said â € œThe fourth.â €  â € œTwo days wrong ! â €  sighed the Hatter .
â € œI told you butter wouldnâ € ™ t suit the works ! â €  he added looking angrily at the March Hare .
â € œIt was the _ best _ butter , â €  the March Hare meekly replied .
â € œYes , but some crumbs must have got in as well , â €  the Hatter grumbled : â € œyou shouldnâ € ™ t have put it in with the bread-knife.â €  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped it into his cup of tea , and looked at it again : but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark , â € œIt was the _ best _ butter , you know.â €  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity .
â € œWhat a funny watch ! â €  she remarked .
â € œIt tells the day of the month , and doesnâ € ™ t tell what oâ € ™ clock it is ! â €  â € œWhy should it ? â €  muttered the Hatter .
â € œDoes _ your _ watch tell you what year it is ? â €  â € œOf course not , â €  Alice replied very readily : â € œbut thatâ € ™ s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.â €  â € œWhich is just the case with _ mine _ , â €  said the Hatter .
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled .
The Hatterâ € ™ s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it , and yet it was certainly English .
â € œI donâ € ™ t quite understand you , â €  she said , as politely as she could .
â € œThe Dormouse is asleep again , â €  said the Hatter , and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose .
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently , and said , without opening its eyes , â € œOf course , of course ; just what I was going to remark myself.â €  â € œHave you guessed the riddle yet ? â €  the Hatter said , turning to Alice again .
â € œNo , I give it up , â €  Alice replied : â € œwhatâ € ™ s the answer ? â €  â € œI havenâ € ™ t the slightest idea , â €  said the Hatter .
â € œNor I , â €  said the March Hare .
Alice sighed wearily .
â € œI think you might do something better with the time , â €  she said , â € œthan waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.â €  â € œIf you knew Time as well as I do , â €  said the Hatter , â € œyou wouldnâ € ™ t talk about wasting _ it _ .
Itâ € ™ s _ him _ .â €  â € œI donâ € ™ t know what you mean , â €  said Alice .
â € œOf course you donâ € ™ t ! â €  the Hatter said , tossing his head contemptuously .
â € œI dare say you never even spoke to Time ! â €  â € œPerhaps not , â €  Alice cautiously replied : â € œbut I know I have to beat time when I learn music.â €  â € œAh !
that accounts for it , â €  said the Hatter .
â € œHe wonâ € ™ t stand beating .
Now , if you only kept on good terms with him , heâ € ™ d do almost anything you liked with the clock .
For instance , suppose it were nine oâ € ™ clock in the morning , just time to begin lessons : youâ € ™ d only have to whisper a hint to Time , and round goes the clock in a twinkling !
Half-past one , time for dinner ! â €  ( â € œI only wish it was , â €  the March Hare said to itself in a whisper . )
â € œThat would be grand , certainly , â €  said Alice thoughtfully : â € œbut thenâ € ” I shouldnâ € ™ t be hungry for it , you know.â €  â € œNot at first , perhaps , â €  said the Hatter : â € œbut you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.â €  â € œIs that the way _ you _ manage ? â €  Alice asked .
The Hatter shook his head mournfully .
â € œNot I ! â €  he replied .
â € œWe quarrelled last Marchâ € ” just before _ he _ went mad , you knowâ € ” â €  ( pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare , ) â € œâ € ” it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts , and I had to sing â € ˜ Twinkle , twinkle , little bat !
How I wonder what youâ € ™ re at ! â € ™ You know the song , perhaps ? â €  â € œIâ € ™ ve heard something like it , â €  said Alice .
â € œIt goes on , you know , â €  the Hatter continued , â € œin this way : â € ” â € ˜ Up above the world you fly , Like a tea-tray in the sky .
Twinkle , twinkleâ € ” â € ™ â €  Here the Dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its sleep â € œ _ Twinkle , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle _ â € ” â €  and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop .
â € œWell , Iâ € ™ d hardly finished the first verse , â €  said the Hatter , â € œwhen the Queen jumped up and bawled out , â € ˜ Heâ € ™ s murdering the time !
Off with his head ! â € ™ â €  â € œHow dreadfully savage ! â €  exclaimed Alice .
â € œAnd ever since that , â €  the Hatter went on in a mournful tone , â € œhe wonâ € ™ t do a thing I ask !
Itâ € ™ s always six oâ € ™ clock now.â €  A bright idea came into Aliceâ € ™ s head .
â € œIs that the reason so many tea-things are put out here ? â €  she asked .
â € œYes , thatâ € ™ s it , â €  said the Hatter with a sigh : â € œitâ € ™ s always tea-time , and weâ € ™ ve no time to wash the things between whiles.â €  â € œThen you keep moving round , I suppose ? â €  said Alice .
â € œExactly so , â €  said the Hatter : â € œas the things get used up.â €  â € œBut what happens when you come to the beginning again ? â €  Alice ventured to ask .
â € œSuppose we change the subject , â €  the March Hare interrupted , yawning .
â € œIâ € ™ m getting tired of this .
I vote the young lady tells us a story.â €  â € œIâ € ™ m afraid I donâ € ™ t know one , â €  said Alice , rather alarmed at the proposal .
â € œThen the Dormouse shall ! â €  they both cried .
â € œWake up , Dormouse ! â €  And they pinched it on both sides at once .
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes .
â € œI wasnâ € ™ t asleep , â €  he said in a hoarse , feeble voice : â € œI heard every word you fellows were saying.â €  â € œTell us a story ! â €  said the March Hare .
â € œYes , please do ! â €  pleaded Alice .
â € œAnd be quick about it , â €  added the Hatter , â € œor youâ € ™ ll be asleep again before itâ € ™ s done.â €  â € œOnce upon a time there were three little sisters , â €  the Dormouse began in a great hurry ; â € œand their names were Elsie , Lacie , and Tillie ; and they lived at the bottom of a wellâ € ” â €  â € œWhat did they live on ? â €  said Alice , who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking .
â € œThey lived on treacle , â €  said the Dormouse , after thinking a minute or two .
â € œThey couldnâ € ™ t have done that , you know , â €  Alice gently remarked ; â € œtheyâ € ™ d have been ill.â €  â € œSo they were , â €  said the Dormouse ; â € œ _ very _ ill.â €  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : â € œBut why did they live at the bottom of a well ? â €  â € œTake some more tea , â €  the March Hare said to Alice , very earnestly .
â € œIâ € ™ ve had nothing yet , â €  Alice replied in an offended tone , â € œso I canâ € ™ t take more.â €  â € œYou mean you canâ € ™ t take _ less _ , â €  said the Hatter : â € œitâ € ™ s very easy to take _ more _ than nothing.â €  â € œNobody asked _ your _ opinion , â €  said Alice .
â € œWhoâ € ™ s making personal remarks now ? â €  the Hatter asked triumphantly .
Alice did not quite know what to say to this : so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter , and then turned to the Dormouse , and repeated her question .
â € œWhy did they live at the bottom of a well ? â €  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it , and then said , â € œIt was a treacle-well.â €  â € œThereâ € ™ s no such thing ! â €  Alice was beginning very angrily , but the Hatter and the March Hare went â € œSh !
sh ! â €  and the Dormouse sulkily remarked , â € œIf you canâ € ™ t be civil , youâ € ™ d better finish the story for yourself.â €  â € œNo , please go on ! â €  Alice said very humbly ; â € œI wonâ € ™ t interrupt again .
I dare say there may be _ one _ .â €  â € œOne , indeed ! â €  said the Dormouse indignantly .
However , he consented to go on .
â € œAnd so these three little sistersâ € ” they were learning to draw , you knowâ € ” â €  â € œWhat did they draw ? â €  said Alice , quite forgetting her promise .
â € œTreacle , â €  said the Dormouse , without considering at all this time .
â € œI want a clean cup , â €  interrupted the Hatter : â € œletâ € ™ s all move one place on.â €  He moved on as he spoke , and the Dormouse followed him : the March Hare moved into the Dormouseâ € ™ s place , and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare .
The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and Alice was a good deal worse off than before , as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate .
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again , so she began very cautiously : â € œBut I donâ € ™ t understand .
Where did they draw the treacle from ? â €  â € œYou can draw water out of a water-well , â €  said the Hatter ; â € œso I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-wellâ € ” eh , stupid ? â €  â € œBut they were _ in _ the well , â €  Alice said to the Dormouse , not choosing to notice this last remark .
â € œOf course they were , â €  said the Dormouse ; â € œâ € ” well in.â €  This answer so confused poor Alice , that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it .
â € œThey were learning to draw , â €  the Dormouse went on , yawning and rubbing its eyes , for it was getting very sleepy ; â € œand they drew all manner of thingsâ € ” everything that begins with an Mâ € ” â €  â € œWhy with an M ? â €  said Alice .
â € œWhy not ? â €  said the March Hare .
Alice was silent .
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time , and was going off into a doze ; but , on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again with a little shriek , and went on : â € œâ € ” that begins with an M , such as mouse-traps , and the moon , and memory , and muchnessâ € ” you know you say things are â € œmuch of a muchnessâ €  â € ” did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ? â €  â € œReally , now you ask me , â €  said Alice , very much confused , â € œI donâ € ™ t thinkâ € ” â €  â € œThen you shouldnâ € ™ t talk , â €  said the Hatter .
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot .
â € œAt any rate Iâ € ™ ll never go _ there _ again ! â €  said Alice as she picked her way through the wood .
â € œItâ € ™ s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life ! â €  Just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it .
â € œThatâ € ™ s very curious ! â €  she thought .
â € œBut everythingâ € ™ s curious today .
I think I may as well go in at once.â €  And in she went .
Once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table .
â € œNow , Iâ € ™ ll manage better this time , â €  she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and unlocking the door that led into the garden .
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and _ then _ â € ” she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains .
CHAPTER VIII .
The Queenâ € ™ s Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red .
Alice thought this a very curious thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , â € œLook out now , Five !
Donâ € ™ t go splashing paint over me like that ! â €  â € œI couldnâ € ™ t help it , â €  said Five , in a sulky tone ; â € œSeven jogged my elbow.â €  On which Seven looked up and said , â € œThatâ € ™ s right , Five !
Always lay the blame on others ! â €  â € œ _ Youâ € ™ d _ better not talk ! â €  said Five .
â € œI heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded ! â €  â € œWhat for ? â €  said the one who had spoken first .
â € œThatâ € ™ s none of _ your _ business , Two ! â €  said Seven .
â € œYes , it _ is _ his business ! â €  said Five , â € œand Iâ € ™ ll tell himâ € ” it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.â €  Seven flung down his brush , and had just begun â € œWell , of all the unjust thingsâ € ” â €  when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice , as she stood watching them , and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also , and all of them bowed low .
â € œWould you tell me , â €  said Alice , a little timidly , â € œwhy you are painting those roses ? â €  Five and Seven said nothing , but looked at Two .
Two began in a low voice , â € œWhy the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a _ red _ rose-tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know .
So you see , Miss , weâ € ™ re doing our best , afore she comes , toâ € ” â €  At this moment Five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out â € œThe Queen !
The Queen ! â €  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces .
There was a sound of many footsteps , and Alice looked round , eager to see the Queen .
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like the three gardeners , oblong and flat , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds , and walked two and two , as the soldiers did .
After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts .
Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit : it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without noticing her .
Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying the Kingâ € ™ s crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and , last of all this grand procession , came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS .
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; â € œand besides , what would be the use of a procession , â €  thought she , â € œif people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they couldnâ € ™ t see it ? â €  So she stood still where she was , and waited .
When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her , and the Queen said severely â € œWho is this ? â €  She said it to the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .
â € œIdiot ! â €  said the Queen , tossing her head impatiently ; and , turning to Alice , she went on , â € œWhatâ € ™ s your name , child ? â €  â € œMy name is Alice , so please your Majesty , â €  said Alice very politely ; but she added , to herself , â € œWhy , theyâ € ™ re only a pack of cards , after all .
I neednâ € ™ t be afraid of them ! â €  â € œAnd who are _ these ? _ â €  said the Queen , pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree ; for , you see , as they were lying on their faces , and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children .
â € œHow should _ I _ know ? â €  said Alice , surprised at her own courage .
â € œItâ € ™ s no business of _ mine _ .â €  The Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , screamed â € œOff with her head !
Offâ € ” â €  â € œNonsense ! â €  said Alice , very loudly and decidedly , and the Queen was silent .
The King laid his hand upon her arm , and timidly said â € œConsider , my dear : she is only a child ! â €  The Queen turned angrily away from him , and said to the Knave â € œTurn them over ! â €  The Knave did so , very carefully , with one foot .
â € œGet up ! â €  said the Queen , in a shrill , loud voice , and the three gardeners instantly jumped up , and began bowing to the King , the Queen , the royal children , and everybody else .
â € œLeave off that ! â €  screamed the Queen .
â € œYou make me giddy.â €  And then , turning to the rose-tree , she went on , â € œWhat _ have _ you been doing here ? â €  â € œMay it please your Majesty , â €  said Two , in a very humble tone , going down on one knee as he spoke , â € œwe were tryingâ € ” â €  â € œ _ I _ see ! â €  said the Queen , who had meanwhile been examining the roses .
â € œOff with their heads ! â €  and the procession moved on , three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners , who ran to Alice for protection .
â € œYou shanâ € ™ t be beheaded ! â €  said Alice , and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near .
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two , looking for them , and then quietly marched off after the others .
â € œAre their heads off ? â €  shouted the Queen .
â € œTheir heads are gone , if it please your Majesty ! â €  the soldiers shouted in reply .
â € œThatâ € ™ s right ! â €  shouted the Queen .
â € œCan you play croquet ? â €  The soldiers were silent , and looked at Alice , as the question was evidently meant for her .
â € œYes ! â €  shouted Alice .
â € œCome on , then ! â €  roared the Queen , and Alice joined the procession , wondering very much what would happen next .
â € œItâ € ™ sâ € ” itâ € ™ s a very fine day ! â €  said a timid voice at her side .
She was walking by the White Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face .
â € œVery , â €  said Alice : â € œâ € ” whereâ € ™ s the Duchess ? â €  â € œHush !
Hush ! â €  said the Rabbit in a low , hurried tone .
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear , and whispered â € œSheâ € ™ s under sentence of execution.â €  â € œWhat for ? â €  said Alice .
â € œDid you say â € ˜ What a pity ! â € ™ ? â €  the Rabbit asked .
â € œNo , I didnâ € ™ t , â €  said Alice : â € œI donâ € ™ t think itâ € ™ s at all a pity .
I said â € ˜ What for ? â € ™ â €  â € œShe boxed the Queenâ € ™ s earsâ € ” â €  the Rabbit began .
Alice gave a little scream of laughter .
â € œOh , hush ! â €  the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone .
â € œThe Queen will hear you !
You see , she came rather late , and the Queen saidâ € ” â €  â € œGet to your places ! â €  shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder , and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other ; however , they got settled down in a minute or two , and the game began .
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live hedgehogs , the mallets live flamingoes , and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it _ would _ twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .
The players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while , and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion , and went stamping about , and shouting â € œOff with his head ! â €  or â € œOff with her head ! â €  about once in a minute .
Alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen , but she knew that it might happen any minute , â € œand then , â €  thought she , â € œwhat would become of me ?
Theyâ € ™ re dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is , that thereâ € ™ s any one left alive ! â €  She was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it a minute or two , she made it out to be a grin , and she said to herself â € œItâ € ™ s the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to.â €  â € œHow are you getting on ? â €  said the Cat , as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with .
Alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded .
â € œItâ € ™ s no use speaking to it , â €  she thought , â € œtill its ears have come , or at least one of them.â €  In another minute the whole head appeared , and then Alice put down her flamingo , and began an account of the game , feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her .
The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight , and no more of it appeared .
â € œI donâ € ™ t think they play at all fairly , â €  Alice began , in rather a complaining tone , â € œand they all quarrel so dreadfully one canâ € ™ t hear oneself speakâ € ” and they donâ € ™ t seem to have any rules in particular ; at least , if there are , nobody attends to themâ € ” and youâ € ™ ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance , thereâ € ™ s the arch Iâ € ™ ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundâ € ” and I should have croqueted the Queenâ € ™ s hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming ! â €  â € œHow do you like the Queen ? â €  said the Cat in a low voice .
â € œNot at all , â €  said Alice : â € œsheâ € ™ s so extremelyâ € ” â €  Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her , listening : so she went on , â € œâ € ” likely to win , that itâ € ™ s hardly worth while finishing the game.â €  The Queen smiled and passed on .
â € œWho _ are _ you talking to ? â €  said the King , going up to Alice , and looking at the Catâ € ™ s head with great curiosity .
â € œItâ € ™ s a friend of mineâ € ” a Cheshire Cat , â €  said Alice : â € œallow me to introduce it.â €  â € œI donâ € ™ t like the look of it at all , â €  said the King : â € œhowever , it may kiss my hand if it likes.â €  â € œIâ € ™ d rather not , â €  the Cat remarked .
â € œDonâ € ™ t be impertinent , â €  said the King , â € œand donâ € ™ t look at me like that ! â €  He got behind Alice as he spoke .
â € œA cat may look at a king , â €  said Alice .
â € œIâ € ™ ve read that in some book , but I donâ € ™ t remember where.â €  â € œWell , it must be removed , â €  said the King very decidedly , and he called the Queen , who was passing at the moment , â € œMy dear !
I wish you would have this cat removed ! â €  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small .
â € œOff with his head ! â €  she said , without even looking round .
â € œIâ € ™ ll fetch the executioner myself , â €  said the King eagerly , and he hurried off .
Alice thought she might as well go back , and see how the game was going on , as she heard the Queenâ € ™ s voice in the distance , screaming with passion .
She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns , and she did not like the look of things at all , as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not .
So she went in search of her hedgehog .
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was , that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden , where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree .
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : â € œbut it doesnâ € ™ t matter much , â €  thought Alice , â € œas all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.â €  So she tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again , and went back for a little more conversation with her friend .
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat , she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it : there was a dispute going on between the executioner , the King , and the Queen , who were all talking at once , while all the rest were quite silent , and looked very uncomfortable .
The moment Alice appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle the question , and they repeated their arguments to her , though , as they all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said .
The executionerâ € ™ s argument was , that you couldnâ € ™ t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he wasnâ € ™ t going to begin at _ his _ time of life .
The Kingâ € ™ s argument was , that anything that had a head could be beheaded , and that you werenâ € ™ t to talk nonsense .
The Queenâ € ™ s argument was , that if something wasnâ € ™ t done about it in less than no time sheâ € ™ d have everybody executed , all round .
( It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious . )
Alice could think of nothing else to say but â € œIt belongs to the Duchess : youâ € ™ d better ask _ her _ about it.â €  â € œSheâ € ™ s in prison , â €  the Queen said to the executioner : â € œfetch her here.â €  And the executioner went off like an arrow .
The Catâ € ™ s head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game .
CHAPTER IX .
The Mock Turtleâ € ™ s Story â € œYou canâ € ™ t think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing ! â €  said the Duchess , as she tucked her arm affectionately into Aliceâ € ™ s , and they walked off together .
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper , and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen .
â € œWhen _ Iâ € ™ m _ a Duchess , â €  she said to herself , ( not in a very hopeful tone though ) , â € œI wonâ € ™ t have any pepper in my kitchen _ at all _ .
Soup does very well withoutâ € ” Maybe itâ € ™ s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered , â €  she went on , very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule , â € œand vinegar that makes them sourâ € ” and camomile that makes them bitterâ € ” andâ € ” and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered .
I only wish people knew _ that _ : then they wouldnâ € ™ t be so stingy about it , you knowâ € ” â €  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear .
â € œYouâ € ™ re thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk .
I canâ € ™ t tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in a bit.â €  â € œPerhaps it hasnâ € ™ t one , â €  Alice ventured to remark .
â € œTut , tut , child ! â €  said the Duchess .
â € œEverythingâ € ™ s got a moral , if only you can find it.â €  And she squeezed herself up closer to Aliceâ € ™ s side as she spoke .
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the Duchess was _ very _ ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Aliceâ € ™ s shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin .
However , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could .
â € œThe gameâ € ™ s going on rather better now , â €  she said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little .
â € œâ € ™ Tis so , â €  said the Duchess : â € œand the moral of that isâ € ” â € ˜ Oh , â € ™ tis love , â € ™ tis love , that makes the world go round ! â € ™ â €  â € œSomebody said , â €  Alice whispered , â € œthat itâ € ™ s done by everybody minding their own business ! â €  â € œAh , well !
It means much the same thing , â €  said the Duchess , digging her sharp little chin into Aliceâ € ™ s shoulder as she added , â € œand the moral of _ that _ isâ € ” â € ˜ Take care of the sense , and the sounds will take care of themselves.â € ™ â €  â € œHow fond she is of finding morals in things ! â €  Alice thought to herself .
â € œI dare say youâ € ™ re wondering why I donâ € ™ t put my arm round your waist , â €  the Duchess said after a pause : â € œthe reason is , that Iâ € ™ m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo .
Shall I try the experiment ? â €  â € œHe might bite , â €  Alice cautiously replied , not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried .
â € œVery true , â €  said the Duchess : â € œflamingoes and mustard both bite .
And the moral of that isâ € ” â € ˜ Birds of a feather flock together.â € ™ â €  â € œOnly mustard isnâ € ™ t a bird , â €  Alice remarked .
â € œRight , as usual , â €  said the Duchess : â € œwhat a clear way you have of putting things ! â €  â € œItâ € ™ s a mineral , I _ think _ , â €  said Alice .
â € œOf course it is , â €  said the Duchess , who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said ; â € œthereâ € ™ s a large mustard-mine near here .
And the moral of that isâ € ” â € ˜ The more there is of mine , the less there is of yours.â € ™ â €  â € œOh , I know ! â €  exclaimed Alice , who had not attended to this last remark , â € œitâ € ™ s a vegetable .
It doesnâ € ™ t look like one , but it is.â €  â € œI quite agree with you , â €  said the Duchess ; â € œand the moral of that isâ € ” â € ˜ Be what you would seem to beâ € ™ â € ” or if youâ € ™ d like it put more simplyâ € ” â € ˜ Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.â € ™ â €  â € œI think I should understand that better , â €  Alice said very politely , â € œif I had it written down : but I canâ € ™ t quite follow it as you say it.â €  â € œThatâ € ™ s nothing to what I could say if I chose , â €  the Duchess replied , in a pleased tone .
â € œPray donâ € ™ t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that , â €  said Alice .
â € œOh , donâ € ™ t talk about trouble ! â €  said the Duchess .
â € œI make you a present of everything Iâ € ™ ve said as yet.â €  â € œA cheap sort of present ! â €  thought Alice .
â € œIâ € ™ m glad they donâ € ™ t give birthday presents like that ! â €  But she did not venture to say it out loud .
â € œThinking again ? â €  the Duchess asked , with another dig of her sharp little chin .
â € œIâ € ™ ve a right to think , â €  said Alice sharply , for she was beginning to feel a little worried .
â € œJust about as much right , â €  said the Duchess , â € œas pigs have to fly ; and the mâ € ” â €  But here , to Aliceâ € ™ s great surprise , the Duchessâ € ™ s voice died away , even in the middle of her favourite word â € ˜ moral , â € ™ and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble .
Alice looked up , and there stood the Queen in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm .
â € œA fine day , your Majesty ! â €  the Duchess began in a low , weak voice .
â € œNow , I give you fair warning , â €  shouted the Queen , stamping on the ground as she spoke ; â € œeither you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time !
Take your choice ! â €  The Duchess took her choice , and was gone in a moment .
â € œLetâ € ™ s go on with the game , â €  the Queen said to Alice ; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word , but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground .
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queenâ € ™ s absence , and were resting in the shade : however , the moment they saw her , they hurried back to the game , the Queen merely remarking that a momentâ € ™ s delay would cost them their lives .
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players , and shouting â € œOff with his head ! â €  or â € œOff with her head ! â €  Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left , and all the players , except the King , the Queen , and Alice , were in custody and under sentence of execution .
Then the Queen left off , quite out of breath , and said to Alice , â € œHave you seen the Mock Turtle yet ? â €  â € œNo , â €  said Alice .
â € œI donâ € ™ t even know what a Mock Turtle is.â €  â € œItâ € ™ s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from , â €  said the Queen .
â € œI never saw one , or heard of one , â €  said Alice .
â € œCome on , then , â €  said the Queen , â € œand he shall tell you his history , â €  As they walked off together , Alice heard the King say in a low voice , to the company generally , â € œYou are all pardoned.â €  â € œCome , _ thatâ € ™ s _ a good thing ! â €  she said to herself , for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered .
They very soon came upon a Gryphon , lying fast asleep in the sun .
( If you donâ € ™ t know what a Gryphon is , look at the picture . )
â € œUp , lazy thing ! â €  said the Queen , â € œand take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle , and to hear his history .
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered ; â €  and she walked off , leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon .
Alice did not quite like the look of the creature , but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen : so she waited .
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight : then it chuckled .
â € œWhat fun ! â €  said the Gryphon , half to itself , half to Alice .
â € œWhat _ is _ the fun ? â €  said Alice .
â € œWhy , _ she _ , â €  said the Gryphon .
â € œItâ € ™ s all her fancy , that : they never executes nobody , you know .
Come on ! â €  â € œEverybody says â € ˜ come on ! â € ™ here , â €  thought Alice , as she went slowly after it : â € œI never was so ordered about in all my life , never ! â €  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock , and , as they came nearer , Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break .
She pitied him deeply .
â € œWhat is his sorrow ? â €  she asked the Gryphon , and the Gryphon answered , very nearly in the same words as before , â € œItâ € ™ s all his fancy , that : he hasnâ € ™ t got no sorrow , you know .
Come on ! â €  So they went up to the Mock Turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears , but said nothing .
â € œThis here young lady , â €  said the Gryphon , â € œshe wants for to know your history , she do.â €  â € œIâ € ™ ll tell it her , â €  said the Mock Turtle in a deep , hollow tone : â € œsit down , both of you , and donâ € ™ t speak a word till Iâ € ™ ve finished.â €  So they sat down , and nobody spoke for some minutes .
Alice thought to herself , â € œI donâ € ™ t see how he can _ ever _ finish , if he doesnâ € ™ t begin.â €  But she waited patiently .
â € œOnce , â €  said the Mock Turtle at last , with a deep sigh , â € œI was a real Turtle.â €  These words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of â € œHjckrrh ! â €  from the Gryphon , and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle .
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying , â € œThank you , sir , for your interesting story , â €  but she could not help thinking there _ must _ be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .
â € œWhen we were little , â €  the Mock Turtle went on at last , more calmly , though still sobbing a little now and then , â € œwe went to school in the sea .
The master was an old Turtleâ € ” we used to call him Tortoiseâ € ” â €  â € œWhy did you call him Tortoise , if he wasnâ € ™ t one ? â €  Alice asked .
â € œWe called him Tortoise because he taught us , â €  said the Mock Turtle angrily : â € œreally you are very dull ! â €  â € œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question , â €  added the Gryphon ; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice , who felt ready to sink into the earth .
At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle , â € œDrive on , old fellow !
Donâ € ™ t be all day about it ! â €  and he went on in these words : â € œYes , we went to school in the sea , though you maynâ € ™ t believe itâ € ” â €  â € œI never said I didnâ € ™ t ! â €  interrupted Alice .
â € œYou did , â €  said the Mock Turtle .
â € œHold your tongue ! â €  added the Gryphon , before Alice could speak again .
The Mock Turtle went on .
â € œWe had the best of educationsâ € ” in fact , we went to school every dayâ € ” â €  â € œ _ Iâ € ™ ve _ been to a day-school , too , â €  said Alice ; â € œyou neednâ € ™ t be so proud as all that.â €  â € œWith extras ? â €  asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously .
â € œYes , â €  said Alice , â € œwe learned French and music.â €  â € œAnd washing ? â €  said the Mock Turtle .
â € œCertainly not ! â €  said Alice indignantly .
â € œAh !
then yours wasnâ € ™ t a really good school , â €  said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief .
â € œNow at _ ours _ they had at the end of the bill , â € ˜ French , music , _ and washing _ â € ” extra.â € ™ â €  â € œYou couldnâ € ™ t have wanted it much , â €  said Alice ; â € œliving at the bottom of the sea.â €  â € œI couldnâ € ™ t afford to learn it.â €  said the Mock Turtle with a sigh .
â € œI only took the regular course.â €  â € œWhat was that ? â €  inquired Alice .
â € œReeling and Writhing , of course , to begin with , â €  the Mock Turtle replied ; â € œand then the different branches of Arithmeticâ € ” Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision.â €  â € œI never heard of â € ˜ Uglification , â € ™ â €  Alice ventured to say .
â € œWhat is it ? â €  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise .
â € œWhat !
Never heard of uglifying ! â €  it exclaimed .
â € œYou know what to beautify is , I suppose ? â €  â € œYes , â €  said Alice doubtfully : â € œit meansâ € ” toâ € ” makeâ € ” anythingâ € ” prettier.â €  â € œWell , then , â €  the Gryphon went on , â € œif you donâ € ™ t know what to uglify is , you _ are _ a simpleton.â €  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it , so she turned to the Mock Turtle , and said â € œWhat else had you to learn ? â €  â € œWell , there was Mystery , â €  the Mock Turtle replied , counting off the subjects on his flappers , â € œâ € ” Mystery , ancient and modern , with Seaography : then Drawlingâ € ” the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel , that used to come once a week : _ he _ taught us Drawling , Stretching , and Fainting in Coils.â €  â € œWhat was _ that _ like ? â €  said Alice .
â € œWell , I canâ € ™ t show it you myself , â €  the Mock Turtle said : â € œIâ € ™ m too stiff .
And the Gryphon never learnt it.â €  â € œHadnâ € ™ t time , â €  said the Gryphon : â € œI went to the Classics master , though .
He was an old crab , _ he _ was.â €  â € œI never went to him , â €  the Mock Turtle said with a sigh : â € œhe taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say.â €  â € œSo he did , so he did , â €  said the Gryphon , sighing in his turn ; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws .
â € œAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons ? â €  said Alice , in a hurry to change the subject .
â € œTen hours the first day , â €  said the Mock Turtle : â € œnine the next , and so on.â €  â € œWhat a curious plan ! â €  exclaimed Alice .
â € œThatâ € ™ s the reason theyâ € ™ re called lessons , â €  the Gryphon remarked : â € œbecause they lessen from day to day.â €  This was quite a new idea to Alice , and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark .
â € œThen the eleventh day must have been a holiday ? â €  â € œOf course it was , â €  said the Mock Turtle .
â € œAnd how did you manage on the twelfth ? â €  Alice went on eagerly .
â € œThatâ € ™ s enough about lessons , â €  the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone : â € œtell her something about the games now.â €  CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes .
He looked at Alice , and tried to speak , but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice .
â € œSame as if he had a bone in his throat , â €  said the Gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back .
At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice , and , with tears running down his cheeks , he went on again : â € ” â € œYou may not have lived much under the seaâ € ” â €  ( â € œI havenâ € ™ t , â €  said Alice ) â € ” â € œand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsterâ € ” â €  ( Alice began to say â € œI once tastedâ € ” â €  but checked herself hastily , and said â € œNo , neverâ €  ) â € œâ € ” so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is ! â €  â € œNo , indeed , â €  said Alice .
â € œWhat sort of a dance is it ? â €  â € œWhy , â €  said the Gryphon , â € œyou first form into a line along the sea-shoreâ € ” â €  â € œTwo lines ! â €  cried the Mock Turtle .
â € œSeals , turtles , salmon , and so on ; then , when youâ € ™ ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the wayâ € ” â €  â € œ _ That _ generally takes some time , â €  interrupted the Gryphon .
â € œâ € ” you advance twiceâ € ” â €  â € œEach with a lobster as a partner ! â €  cried the Gryphon .
â € œOf course , â €  the Mock Turtle said : â € œadvance twice , set to partnersâ € ” â €  â € œâ € ” change lobsters , and retire in same order , â €  continued the Gryphon .
â € œThen , you know , â €  the Mock Turtle went on , â € œyou throw theâ € ” â €  â € œThe lobsters ! â €  shouted the Gryphon , with a bound into the air .
â € œâ € ” as far out to sea as you canâ € ” â €  â € œSwim after them ! â €  screamed the Gryphon .
â € œTurn a somersault in the sea ! â €  cried the Mock Turtle , capering wildly about .
â € œChange lobsters again ! â €  yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice .
â € œBack to land again , and thatâ € ™ s all the first figure , â €  said the Mock Turtle , suddenly dropping his voice ; and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly , and looked at Alice .
â € œIt must be a very pretty dance , â €  said Alice timidly .
â € œWould you like to see a little of it ? â €  said the Mock Turtle .
â € œVery much indeed , â €  said Alice .
â € œCome , letâ € ™ s try the first figure ! â €  said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon .
â € œWe can do without lobsters , you know .
Which shall sing ? â €  â € œOh , _ you _ sing , â €  said the Gryphon .
â € œIâ € ™ ve forgotten the words.â €  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice , every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close , and waving their forepaws to mark the time , while the Mock Turtle sang this , very slowly and sadly : â € ” â € œWill you walk a little faster ? â €  said a whiting to a snail .
â € œThereâ € ™ s a porpoise close behind us , and heâ € ™ s treading on my tail .
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
They are waiting on the shingleâ € ” will you come and join the dance ?
Will you , wonâ € ™ t you , will you , wonâ € ™ t you , will you join the dance ?
Will you , wonâ € ™ t you , will you , wonâ € ™ t you , wonâ € ™ t you join the dance ?
â € œYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! â €  But the snail replied â € œToo far , too far ! â €  and gave a look askanceâ € ” Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance .
â € œWhat matters it how far we go ? â €  his scaly friend replied .
â € œThere is another shore , you know , upon the other side .
The further off from England the nearer is to Franceâ € ” Then turn not pale , beloved snail , but come and join the dance .
Will you , wonâ € ™ t you , will you , wonâ € ™ t you , will you join the dance ?
Will you , wonâ € ™ t you , will you , wonâ € ™ t you , wonâ € ™ t you join the dance ? â €  â € œThank you , itâ € ™ s a very interesting dance to watch , â €  said Alice , feeling very glad that it was over at last : â € œand I do so like that curious song about the whiting ! â €  â € œOh , as to the whiting , â €  said the Mock Turtle , â € œtheyâ € ” youâ € ™ ve seen them , of course ? â €  â € œYes , â €  said Alice , â € œIâ € ™ ve often seen them at dinnâ € ” â €  she checked herself hastily .
â € œI donâ € ™ t know where Dinn may be , â €  said the Mock Turtle , â € œbut if youâ € ™ ve seen them so often , of course you know what theyâ € ™ re like.â €  â € œI believe so , â €  Alice replied thoughtfully .
â € œThey have their tails in their mouthsâ € ” and theyâ € ™ re all over crumbs.â €  â € œYouâ € ™ re wrong about the crumbs , â €  said the Mock Turtle : â € œcrumbs would all wash off in the sea .
But they _ have _ their tails in their mouths ; and the reason isâ € ” â €  here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.â € ” â € œTell her about the reason and all that , â €  he said to the Gryphon .
â € œThe reason is , â €  said the Gryphon , â € œthat they _ would _ go with the lobsters to the dance .
So they got thrown out to sea .
So they had to fall a long way .
So they got their tails fast in their mouths .
So they couldnâ € ™ t get them out again .
Thatâ € ™ s all.â €  â € œThank you , â €  said Alice , â € œitâ € ™ s very interesting .
I never knew so much about a whiting before.â €  â € œI can tell you more than that , if you like , â €  said the Gryphon .
â € œDo you know why itâ € ™ s called a whiting ? â €  â € œI never thought about it , â €  said Alice .
â € œWhy ? â €  â € œ _ It does the boots and shoes _ , â €  the Gryphon replied very solemnly .
Alice was thoroughly puzzled .
â € œDoes the boots and shoes ! â €  she repeated in a wondering tone .
â € œWhy , what are _ your _ shoes done with ? â €  said the Gryphon .
â € œI mean , what makes them so shiny ? â €  Alice looked down at them , and considered a little before she gave her answer .
â € œTheyâ € ™ re done with blacking , I believe.â €  â € œBoots and shoes under the sea , â €  the Gryphon went on in a deep voice , â € œare done with a whiting .
Now you know.â €  â € œAnd what are they made of ? â €  Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity .
â € œSoles and eels , of course , â €  the Gryphon replied rather impatiently : â € œany shrimp could have told you that.â €  â € œIf Iâ € ™ d been the whiting , â €  said Alice , whose thoughts were still running on the song , â € œIâ € ™ d have said to the porpoise , â € ˜ Keep back , please : we donâ € ™ t want _ you _ with us ! â € ™ â €  â € œThey were obliged to have him with them , â €  the Mock Turtle said : â € œno wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.â €  â € œWouldnâ € ™ t it really ? â €  said Alice in a tone of great surprise .
â € œOf course not , â €  said the Mock Turtle : â € œwhy , if a fish came to _ me _ , and told me he was going a journey , I should say â € ˜ With what porpoise ? â € ™ â €  â € œDonâ € ™ t you mean â € ˜ purposeâ € ™ ? â €  said Alice .
â € œI mean what I say , â €  the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone .
And the Gryphon added â € œCome , letâ € ™ s hear some of _ your _ adventures.â €  â € œI could tell you my adventuresâ € ” beginning from this morning , â €  said Alice a little timidly : â € œbut itâ € ™ s no use going back to yesterday , because I was a different person then.â €  â € œExplain all that , â €  said the Mock Turtle .
â € œNo , no !
The adventures first , â €  said the Gryphon in an impatient tone : â € œexplanations take such a dreadful time.â €  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit .
She was a little nervous about it just at first , the two creatures got so close to her , one on each side , and opened their eyes and mouths so _ very _ wide , but she gained courage as she went on .
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating â € œ _ You are old , Father William _ , â €  to the Caterpillar , and the words all coming different , and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath , and said â € œThatâ € ™ s very curious.â €  â € œItâ € ™ s all about as curious as it can be , â €  said the Gryphon .
â € œIt all came different ! â €  the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully .
â € œI should like to hear her try and repeat something now .
Tell her to begin.â €  He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice .
â € œStand up and repeat â € ˜ â € ™ _ Tis the voice of the sluggard _ , â € ™ â €  said the Gryphon .
â € œHow the creatures order one about , and make one repeat lessons ! â €  thought Alice ; â € œI might as well be at school at once.â €  However , she got up , and began to repeat it , but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille , that she hardly knew what she was saying , and the words came very queer indeed : â € ” â € œâ € ™ Tis the voice of the Lobster ; I heard him declare , â € œYou have baked me too brown , I must sugar my hair.â €  As a duck with its eyelids , so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons , and turns out his toes.â €  &#91; later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry , he is gay as a lark , And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark , But , when the tide rises and sharks are around , His voice has a timid and tremulous sound . &#93;
â € œThatâ € ™ s different from what _ I _ used to say when I was a child , â €  said the Gryphon .
â € œWell , I never heard it before , â €  said the Mock Turtle ; â € œbut it sounds uncommon nonsense.â €  Alice said nothing ; she had sat down with her face in her hands , wondering if anything would _ ever _ happen in a natural way again .
â € œI should like to have it explained , â €  said the Mock Turtle .
â € œShe canâ € ™ t explain it , â €  said the Gryphon hastily .
â € œGo on with the next verse.â €  â € œBut about his toes ? â €  the Mock Turtle persisted .
â € œHow _ could _ he turn them out with his nose , you know ? â €  â € œItâ € ™ s the first position in dancing.â €  Alice said ; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing , and longed to change the subject .
â € œGo on with the next verse , â €  the Gryphon repeated impatiently : â € œit begins â € ˜ _ I passed by his garden _ .â € ™ â €  Alice did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come wrong , and she went on in a trembling voice : â € ” â € œI passed by his garden , and marked , with one eye , How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pieâ € ” â €  &#91; later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust , and gravy , and meat , While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat .
When the pie was all finished , the Owl , as a boon , Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon : While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl , And concluded the banquetâ € ” &#93; â € œWhat _ is _ the use of repeating all that stuff , â €  the Mock Turtle interrupted , â € œif you donâ € ™ t explain it as you go on ?
Itâ € ™ s by far the most confusing thing _ I _ ever heard ! â €  â € œYes , I think youâ € ™ d better leave off , â €  said the Gryphon : and Alice was only too glad to do so .
â € œShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille ? â €  the Gryphon went on .
â € œOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song ? â €  â € œOh , a song , please , if the Mock Turtle would be so kind , â €  Alice replied , so eagerly that the Gryphon said , in a rather offended tone , â € œHm !
No accounting for tastes !
Sing her â € ˜ _ Turtle Soup _ , â € ™ will you , old fellow ? â €  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and began , in a voice sometimes choked with sobs , to sing this : â € ” â € œBeautiful Soup , so rich and green , Waiting in a hot tureen !
Who for such dainties would not stoop ?
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
Beauâ € ” ootiful Sooâ € ” oop !
Beauâ € ” ootiful Sooâ € ” oop !
Sooâ € ” oop of the eâ € ” eâ € ” evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup !
â € œBeautiful Soup !
Who cares for fish , Game , or any other dish ?
Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup ?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ?
Beauâ € ” ootiful Sooâ € ” oop !
Beauâ € ” ootiful Sooâ € ” oop !
Sooâ € ” oop of the eâ € ” eâ € ” evening , Beautiful , beautiâ € ” FUL SOUP ! â €  â € œChorus again ! â €  cried the Gryphon , and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it , when a cry of â € œThe trialâ € ™ s beginning ! â €  was heard in the distance .
â € œCome on ! â €  cried the Gryphon , and , taking Alice by the hand , it hurried off , without waiting for the end of the song .
â € œWhat trial is it ? â €  Alice panted as she ran ; but the Gryphon only answered â € œCome on ! â €  and ran the faster , while more and more faintly came , carried on the breeze that followed them , the melancholy words : â € ” â € œSooâ € ” oop of the eâ € ” eâ € ” evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup ! â €  CHAPTER XI .
