No , itâ € ™ ll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â €  Down , down , down .
There was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began talking again .
â € œDinahâ € ™ ll miss me very much to-night , I should think ! â €  ( Dinah was the cat . )
â € œI hope theyâ € ™ ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time .
Dinah my dear !
I wish you were down here with me !
There are no mice in the air , Iâ € ™ m afraid , but you might catch a bat , and thatâ € ™ s very like a mouse , you know .
But do cats eat bats , I wonder ? â €  And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , â € œDo cats eat bats ?
Do cats eat bats ? â €  and sometimes , â € œDo bats eat cats ? â €  for , you see , as she couldnâ € ™ t answer either question , it didnâ € ™ t much matter which way she put it .
She felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , â € œNow , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? â €  when suddenly , thump !
thump !
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over .
Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .
There was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , â € œOh my ears and whiskers , how late itâ € ™ s getting ! â €  She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof .
There were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and Aliceâ € ™ s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas !
either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them .
However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw .
How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; â € œand even if my head would go through , â €  thought poor Alice , â € œit would be of very little use without my shoulders .
Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope !
I think I could , if I only knew how to begin.â €  For , you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( â € œwhich certainly was not here before , â €  said Alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words â € œDRINK ME , â €  beautifully printed on it in large letters .
It was all very well to say â € œDrink me , â €  but the wise little Alice was not going to do _ that _ in a hurry .
â € œNo , Iâ € ™ ll look first , â €  she said , â € œand see whether itâ € ™ s marked â € ˜ _ poison _ â € ™ or notâ €  ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they _ would _ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger _ very _ deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked â € œpoison , â €  it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .
However , this bottle was _ not _ marked â € œpoison , â €  so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * â € œWhat a curious feeling ! â €  said Alice ; â € œI must be shutting up like a telescope.â €  And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden .
First , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; â € œfor it might end , you know , â €  said Alice to herself , â € œin my going out altogether , like a candle .
I wonder what I should be like then ? â €  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing .
After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice !
when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .
â € œCome , thereâ € ™ s no use in crying like that ! â €  said Alice to herself , rather sharply ; â € œI advise you to leave off this minute ! â €  She generally gave herself very good advice , ( though she very seldom followed it ) , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people .
â € œBut itâ € ™ s no use now , â €  thought poor Alice , â € œto pretend to be two people !
Why , thereâ € ™ s hardly enough of me left to make _ one _ respectable person ! â €  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words â € œEAT MEâ €  were beautifully marked in currants .
â € œWell , Iâ € ™ ll eat it , â €  said Alice , â € œand if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way Iâ € ™ ll get into the garden , and I donâ € ™ t care which happens ! â €  She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , â € œWhich way ?
Which way ? â €  , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way .
So she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II .
The Pool of Tears â € œCuriouser and curiouser ! â €  cried Alice ( she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) ; â € œnow Iâ € ™ m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was !
Good-bye , feet ! â €  ( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off ) .
â € œOh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ?
Iâ € ™ m sure _ I _ shanâ € ™ t be able !
I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ; â € ” but I must be kind to them , â €  thought Alice , â € œor perhaps they wonâ € ™ t walk the way I want to go !
Let me see : Iâ € ™ ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.â €  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it .
â € œThey must go by the carrier , â €  she thought ; â € œand how funny itâ € ™ ll seem , sending presents to oneâ € ™ s own feet !
And how odd the directions will look !
_ Aliceâ € ™ s Right Foot , Esq . , Hearthrug , near the Fender , _ ( _ with Aliceâ € ™ s love _ ) .
Oh dear , what nonsense Iâ € ™ m talking ! â €  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door .
Poor Alice !
It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again .
â € œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself , â €  said Alice , â € œa great girl like you , â €  ( she might well say this ) , â € œto go on crying in this way !
Stop this moment , I tell you ! â €  But she went on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall .
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming .
It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , â € œOh !
the Duchess , the Duchess !
Oh !
wonâ € ™ t she be savage if Iâ € ™ ve kept her waiting ! â €  Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , â € œIf you please , sirâ € ” â €  The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .
Alice took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : â € œDear , dear !
How queer everything is to-day !
And yesterday things went on just as usual .
I wonder if Iâ € ™ ve been changed in the night ?
Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different .
But if Iâ € ™ m not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ?
Ah , _ thatâ € ™ s _ the great puzzle ! â €  And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them .
â € œIâ € ™ m sure Iâ € ™ m not Ada , â €  she said , â € œfor her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine doesnâ € ™ t go in ringlets at all ; and Iâ € ™ m sure I canâ € ™ t be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh !
she knows such a very little !
Besides , _ sheâ € ™ s _ she , and _ Iâ € ™ m _ I , andâ € ” oh dear , how puzzling it all is !
Iâ € ™ ll try if I know all the things I used to know .
Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven isâ € ” oh dear !
I shall never get to twenty at that rate !
However , the Multiplication Table doesnâ € ™ t signify : letâ € ™ s try Geography .
London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Romeâ € ” no , _ thatâ € ™ s _ all wrong , Iâ € ™ m certain !
I must have been changed for Mabel !
Iâ € ™ ll try and say â € ˜ _ How doth the little _ â € ” â € ™ â €  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not come the same as they used to do : â € ” â € œHow doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale !
â € œHow cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws ! â €  â € œIâ € ™ m sure those are not the right words , â €  said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , â € œI must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh !
ever so many lessons to learn !
No , Iâ € ™ ve made up my mind about it ; if Iâ € ™ m Mabel , Iâ € ™ ll stay down here !
Itâ € ™ ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying â € ˜ Come up again , dear ! â € ™ I shall only look up and say â € ˜ Who am I then ?
Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , Iâ € ™ ll come up : if not , Iâ € ™ ll stay down here till Iâ € ™ m somebody elseâ € ™ â € ” but , oh dear ! â €  cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , â € œI do wish they _ would _ put their heads down !
I am so _ very _ tired of being all alone here ! â €  As she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbitâ € ™ s little white kid gloves while she was talking .
â € œHow _ can _ I have done that ? â €  she thought .
â € œI must be growing small again.â €  She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .
â € œThat _ was _ a narrow escape ! â €  said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; â € œand now for the garden ! â €  and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas !
the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , â € œand things are worse than ever , â €  thought the poor child , â € œfor I never was so small as this before , never !
And I declare itâ € ™ s too bad , that it is ! â €  As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash !
she was up to her chin in salt water .
Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , â € œand in that case I can go back by railway , â €  she said to herself .
( Alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . )
However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high .
â € œI wish I hadnâ € ™ t cried so much ! â €  said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out .
â € œI shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears !
That _ will _ be a queer thing , to be sure !
However , everything is queer to-day.â €  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
â € œWould it be of any use , now , â €  thought Alice , â € œto speak to this mouse ?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , thereâ € ™ s no harm in trying.â €  So she began : â € œO Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ?
I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! â €  ( Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brotherâ € ™ s Latin Grammar , â € œA mouseâ € ” of a mouseâ € ” to a mouseâ € ” a mouseâ € ” O mouse ! â €  ) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing .
â € œPerhaps it doesnâ € ™ t understand English , â €  thought Alice ; â € œI daresay itâ € ™ s a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror.â €  ( For , with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . )
So she began again : â € œOÃ ¹ est ma chatte ? â €  which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book .
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright .
â € œOh , I beg your pardon ! â €  cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animalâ € ™ s feelings .
â € œI quite forgot you didnâ € ™ t like cats.â €  â € œNot like cats ! â €  cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice .
â € œWould _ you _ like cats if you were me ? â €  â € œWell , perhaps not , â €  said Alice in a soothing tone : â € œdonâ € ™ t be angry about it .
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think youâ € ™ d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her .
She is such a dear quiet thing , â €  Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , â € œand she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her faceâ € ” and she is such a nice soft thing to nurseâ € ” and sheâ € ™ s such a capital one for catching miceâ € ” oh , I beg your pardon ! â €  cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended .
â € œWe wonâ € ™ t talk about her any more if youâ € ™ d rather not.â €  â € œWe indeed ! â €  cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail .
â € œAs if _ I _ would talk on such a subject !
Our family always _ hated _ cats : nasty , low , vulgar things !
Donâ € ™ t let me hear the name again ! â €  â € œI wonâ € ™ t indeed ! â €  said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation .
â € œAre youâ € ” are you fondâ € ” ofâ € ” of dogs ? â €  The Mouse did not answer , so Alice went on eagerly : â € œThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you !
A little bright-eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair !
And itâ € ™ ll fetch things when you throw them , and itâ € ™ ll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of thingsâ € ” I canâ € ™ t remember half of themâ € ” and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says itâ € ™ s so useful , itâ € ™ s worth a hundred pounds !
He says it kills all the rats andâ € ” oh dear ! â €  cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , â € œIâ € ™ m afraid Iâ € ™ ve offended it again ! â €  For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went .
So she called softly after it , â € œMouse dear !
Do come back again , and we wonâ € ™ t talk about cats or dogs either , if you donâ € ™ t like them ! â €  When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , Alice thought ) , and it said in a low trembling voice , â € œLet us get to the shore , and then Iâ € ™ ll tell you my history , and youâ € ™ ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.â €  It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures .
Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .
CHAPTER III .
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankâ € ” the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable .
The first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this , and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life .
Indeed , she had quite a long argument with the Lory , who at last turned sulky , and would only say , â € œI am older than you , and must know better ; â €  and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was , and , as the Lory positively refused to tell its age , there was no more to be said .
At last the Mouse , who seemed to be a person of authority among them , called out , â € œSit down , all of you , and listen to me !
_ Iâ € ™ ll _ soon make you dry enough ! â €  They all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the Mouse in the middle .
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon .
â € œAhem ! â €  said the Mouse with an important air , â € œare you all ready ?
This is the driest thing I know .
Silence all round , if you please !
â € ˜ William the Conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the English , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest .
Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbriaâ € ” â € ™ â €  â € œUgh ! â €  said the Lory , with a shiver .
â € œI beg your pardon ! â €  said the Mouse , frowning , but very politely : â € œDid you speak ? â €  â € œNot I ! â €  said the Lory hastily .
â € œI thought you did , â €  said the Mouse .
â € œâ € ” I proceed .
â € ˜ Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisableâ € ” â € ™ â €  â € œFound _ what _ ? â €  said the Duck .
â € œFound _ it _ , â €  the Mouse replied rather crossly : â € œof course you know what â € ˜ itâ € ™ means.â €  â € œI know what â € ˜ itâ € ™ means well enough , when _ I _ find a thing , â €  said the Duck : â € œitâ € ™ s generally a frog or a worm .
The question is , what did the archbishop find ? â €  The Mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , â € œâ € ˜ â € ” found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown .
Williamâ € ™ s conduct at first was moderate .
But the insolence of his Normansâ € ” â € ™ How are you getting on now , my dear ? â €  it continued , turning to Alice as it spoke .
â € œAs wet as ever , â €  said Alice in a melancholy tone : â € œit doesnâ € ™ t seem to dry me at all.â €  â € œIn that case , â €  said the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet , â € œI move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remediesâ € ” â €  â € œSpeak English ! â €  said the Eaglet .
â € œI donâ € ™ t know the meaning of half those long words , and , whatâ € ™ s more , I donâ € ™ t believe you do either ! â €  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of the other birds tittered audibly .
â € œWhat I was going to say , â €  said the Dodo in an offended tone , â € œwas , that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.â €  â € œWhat _ is _ a Caucus-race ? â €  said Alice ; not that she wanted much to know , but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _ somebody _ ought to speak , and no one else seemed inclined to say anything .
â € œWhy , â €  said the Dodo , â € œthe best way to explain it is to do it.â €  ( And , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , I will tell you how the Dodo managed it . )
First it marked out a race-course , in a sort of circle , ( â € œthe exact shape doesnâ € ™ t matter , â €  it said , ) and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there .
There was no â € œOne , two , three , and away , â €  but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over .
However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out â € œThe race is over ! â €  and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , â € œBut who has won ? â €  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him ) , while the rest waited in silence .
At last the Dodo said , â € œ _ Everybody _ has won , and all must have prizes.â €  â € œBut who is to give the prizes ? â €  quite a chorus of voices asked .
â € œWhy , _ she _ , of course , â €  said the Dodo , pointing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused way , â € œPrizes !
Prizes ! â €  Alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) , and handed them round as prizes .
There was exactly one a-piece , all round .
â € œBut she must have a prize herself , you know , â €  said the Mouse .
â € œOf course , â €  the Dodo replied very gravely .
â € œWhat else have you got in your pocket ? â €  he went on , turning to Alice .
â € œOnly a thimble , â €  said Alice sadly .
â € œHand it over here , â €  said the Dodo .
Then they all crowded round her once more , while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble , saying â € œWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ; â €  and , when it had finished this short speech , they all cheered .
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could .
The next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back .
However , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the Mouse to tell them something more .
â € œYou promised to tell me your history , you know , â €  said Alice , â € œand why it is you hateâ € ” C and D , â €  she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would be offended again .
â € œMine is a long and a sad tale ! â €  said the Mouse , turning to Alice , and sighing .
â € œIt _ is _ a long tail , certainly , â €  said Alice , looking down with wonder at the Mouseâ € ™ s tail ; â € œbut why do you call it sad ? â €  And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this : â € ” â € œFury said to a mouse , That he met in the house , â € ˜ Let us both go to law : _ I _ will prosecute _ you _ .â € ” Come , Iâ € ™ ll take no denial ; We must have a trial : For really this morning Iâ € ™ ve nothing to do.â € ™ Said the mouse to the cur , â € ˜ Such a trial , dear sir , With no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath.â € ™ â € ˜ Iâ € ™ ll be judge , Iâ € ™ ll be jury , â € ™ Said cunning old Fury : â € ˜ Iâ € ™ ll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death.â € ™ â €  â € œYou are not attending ! â €  said the Mouse to Alice severely .
â € œWhat are you thinking of ? â €  â € œI beg your pardon , â €  said Alice very humbly : â € œyou had got to the fifth bend , I think ? â €  â € œI had _ not ! _ â €  cried the Mouse , sharply and very angrily .
â € œA knot ! â €  said Alice , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her .
â € œOh , do let me help to undo it ! â €  â € œI shall do nothing of the sort , â €  said the Mouse , getting up and walking away .
â € œYou insult me by talking such nonsense ! â €  â € œI didnâ € ™ t mean it ! â €  pleaded poor Alice .
â € œBut youâ € ™ re so easily offended , you know ! â €  The Mouse only growled in reply .
â € œPlease come back and finish your story ! â €  Alice called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus , â € œYes , please do ! â €  but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently , and walked a little quicker .
â € œWhat a pity it wouldnâ € ™ t stay ! â €  sighed the Lory , as soon as it was quite out of sight ; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter â € œAh , my dear !
Let this be a lesson to you never to lose _ your _ temper ! â €  â € œHold your tongue , Ma ! â €  said the young Crab , a little snappishly .
â € œYouâ € ™ re enough to try the patience of an oyster ! â €  â € œI wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do ! â €  said Alice aloud , addressing nobody in particular .
â € œSheâ € ™ d soon fetch it back ! â €  â € œAnd who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the question ? â €  said the Lory .
Alice replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet : â € œDinahâ € ™ s our cat .
And sheâ € ™ s such a capital one for catching mice you canâ € ™ t think !
And oh , I wish you could see her after the birds !
Why , sheâ € ™ ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! â €  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party .
Some of the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking , â € œI really must be getting home ; the night-air doesnâ € ™ t suit my throat ! â €  and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , â € œCome away , my dears !
Itâ € ™ s high time you were all in bed ! â €  On various pretexts they all moved off , and Alice was soon left alone .
â € œI wish I hadnâ € ™ t mentioned Dinah ! â €  she said to herself in a melancholy tone .
â € œNobody seems to like her , down here , and Iâ € ™ m sure sheâ € ™ s the best cat in the world !
Oh , my dear Dinah !
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more ! â €  And here poor Alice began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low-spirited .
In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story .
CHAPTER IV .
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ; and she heard it muttering to itself â € œThe Duchess !
The Duchess !
Oh my dear paws !
Oh my fur and whiskers !
Sheâ € ™ ll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets !
Where _ can _ I have dropped them , I wonder ? â €  Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves , and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were nowhere to be seenâ € ” everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely .
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice , as she went hunting about , and called out to her in an angry tone , â € œWhy , Mary Ann , what _ are _ you doing out here ?
Run home this moment , and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan !
Quick , now ! â €  And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the mistake it had made .
â € œHe took me for his housemaid , â €  she said to herself as she ran .
â € œHow surprised heâ € ™ ll be when he finds out who I am !
But Iâ € ™ d better take him his fan and glovesâ € ” that is , if I can find them.â €  As she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name â € œW .
RABBIT , â €  engraved upon it .
She went in without knocking , and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann , and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves .
â € œHow queer it seems , â €  Alice said to herself , â € œto be going messages for a rabbit !
I suppose Dinahâ € ™ ll be sending me on messages next ! â €  And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen : â € œâ € ˜ Miss Alice !
Come here directly , and get ready for your walk ! â € ™ â € ˜ Coming in a minute , nurse !
But Iâ € ™ ve got to see that the mouse doesnâ € ™ t get out.â € ™ Only I donâ € ™ t think , â €  Alice went on , â € œthat theyâ € ™ d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ! â €  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass .
There was no label this time with the words â € œDRINK ME , â €  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips .
â € œI know _ something _ interesting is sure to happen , â €  she said to herself , â € œwhenever I eat or drink anything ; so Iâ € ™ ll just see what this bottle does .
I do hope itâ € ™ ll make me grow large again , for really Iâ € ™ m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! â €  It did so indeed , and much sooner than she had expected : before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken .
She hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself â € œThatâ € ™ s quite enoughâ € ” I hope I shanâ € ™ t grow any moreâ € ” As it is , I canâ € ™ t get out at the doorâ € ” I do wish I hadnâ € ™ t drunk quite so much ! â €  Alas !
it was too late to wish that !
She went on growing , and growing , and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this , and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door , and the other arm curled round her head .
Still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself â € œNow I can do no more , whatever happens .
What _ will _ become of me ? â €  Luckily for Alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .
â € œIt was much pleasanter at home , â €  thought poor Alice , â € œwhen one wasnâ € ™ t always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and rabbits .
I almost wish I hadnâ € ™ t gone down that rabbit-holeâ € ” and yetâ € ” and yetâ € ” itâ € ™ s rather curious , you know , this sort of life !
I do wonder what _ can _ have happened to me !
When I used to read fairy-tales , I fancied that kind of thing never happened , and now here I am in the middle of one !
There ought to be a book written about me , that there ought !
And when I grow up , Iâ € ™ ll write oneâ € ” but Iâ € ™ m grown up now , â €  she added in a sorrowful tone ; â € œat least thereâ € ™ s no room to grow up any more _ here _ .â €  â € œBut then , â €  thought Alice , â € œshall I _ never _ get any older than I am now ?
Thatâ € ™ ll be a comfort , one wayâ € ” never to be an old womanâ € ” but thenâ € ” always to have lessons to learn !
Oh , I shouldnâ € ™ t like _ that ! _ â €  â € œOh , you foolish Alice ! â €  she answered herself .
â € œHow can you learn lessons in here ?
Why , thereâ € ™ s hardly room for _ you _ , and no room at all for any lesson-books ! â €  And so she went on , taking first one side and then the other , and making quite a conversation of it altogether ; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside , and stopped to listen .
â € œMary Ann !
Mary Ann ! â €  said the voice .
â € œFetch me my gloves this moment ! â €  Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs .
Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it .
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door , and tried to open it ; but , as the door opened inwards , and Aliceâ € ™ s elbow was pressed hard against it , that attempt proved a failure .
Alice heard it say to itself â € œThen Iâ € ™ ll go round and get in at the window.â €  â € œ _ That _ you wonâ € ™ t ! â €  thought Alice , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air .
She did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame , or something of the sort .
Next came an angry voiceâ € ” the Rabbitâ € ™ sâ € ” â € œPat !
Pat !
Where are you ? â €  And then a voice she had never heard before , â € œSure then Iâ € ™ m here !
Digging for apples , yer honour ! â €  â € œDigging for apples , indeed ! â €  said the Rabbit angrily .
â € œHere !
Come and help me out of _ this ! _ â €  ( Sounds of more broken glass . )
â € œNow tell me , Pat , whatâ € ™ s that in the window ? â €  â € œSure , itâ € ™ s an arm , yer honour ! â €  ( He pronounced it â € œarrum.â €  ) â € œAn arm , you goose !
Who ever saw one that size ?
Why , it fills the whole window ! â €  â € œSure , it does , yer honour : but itâ € ™ s an arm for all that.â €  â € œWell , itâ € ™ s got no business there , at any rate : go and take it away ! â €  There was a long silence after this , and Alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , â € œSure , I donâ € ™ t like it , yer honour , at all , at all ! â €  â € œDo as I tell you , you coward ! â €  and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air .
This time there were _ two _ little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass .
â € œWhat a number of cucumber-frames there must be ! â €  thought Alice .
â € œI wonder what theyâ € ™ ll do next !
As for pulling me out of the window , I only wish they _ could ! _ Iâ € ™ m sure _ I _ donâ € ™ t want to stay in here any longer ! â €  She waited for some time without hearing anything more : at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels , and the sound of a good many voices all talking together : she made out the words : â € œWhereâ € ™ s the other ladder ? â € ” Why , I hadnâ € ™ t to bring but one ; Billâ € ™ s got the otherâ € ” Bill !
fetch it here , lad ! â € ” Here , put â € ™ em up at this cornerâ € ” No , tie â € ™ em together firstâ € ” they donâ € ™ t reach half high enough yetâ € ” Oh !
theyâ € ™ ll do well enough ; donâ € ™ t be particularâ € ” Here , Bill !
catch hold of this ropeâ € ” Will the roof bear ? â € ” Mind that loose slateâ € ” Oh , itâ € ™ s coming down !
Heads below ! â €  ( a loud crash ) â € ” â € œNow , who did that ? â € ” It was Bill , I fancyâ € ” Whoâ € ™ s to go down the chimney ? â € ” Nay , _ I _ shanâ € ™ t !
_ You _ do it ! â € ” _ That _ I wonâ € ™ t , then ! â € ” Billâ € ™ s to go downâ € ” Here , Bill !
the master says youâ € ™ re to go down the chimney ! â €  â € œOh !
So Billâ € ™ s got to come down the chimney , has he ? â €  said Alice to herself .
â € œShy , they seem to put everything upon Bill !
I wouldnâ € ™ t be in Billâ € ™ s place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but I _ think _ I can kick a little ! â €  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could , and waited till she heard a little animal ( she couldnâ € ™ t guess of what sort it was ) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her : then , saying to herself â € œThis is Bill , â €  she gave one sharp kick , and waited to see what would happen next .
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of â € œThere goes Bill ! â €  then the Rabbitâ € ™ s voice alongâ € ” â € œCatch him , you by the hedge ! â €  then silence , and then another confusion of voicesâ € ” â € œHold up his headâ € ” Brandy nowâ € ” Donâ € ™ t choke himâ € ” How was it , old fellow ?
What happened to you ?
Tell us all about it ! â €  Last came a little feeble , squeaking voice , ( â € œThatâ € ™ s Bill , â €  thought Alice , ) â € œWell , I hardly knowâ € ” No more , thank ye ; Iâ € ™ m better nowâ € ” but Iâ € ™ m a deal too flustered to tell youâ € ” all I know is , something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box , and up I goes like a sky-rocket ! â €  â € œSo you did , old fellow ! â €  said the others .
â € œWe must burn the house down ! â €  said the Rabbitâ € ™ s voice ; and Alice called out as loud as she could , â € œIf you do , Iâ € ™ ll set Dinah at you ! â €  There was a dead silence instantly , and Alice thought to herself , â € œI wonder what they _ will _ do next !
If they had any sense , theyâ € ™ d take the roof off.â €  After a minute or two , they began moving about again , and Alice heard the Rabbit say , â € œA barrowful will do , to begin with.â €  â € œA barrowful of _ what ? _ â €  thought Alice ; but she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window , and some of them hit her in the face .
â € œIâ € ™ ll put a stop to this , â €  she said to herself , and shouted out , â € œYouâ € ™ d better not do that again ! â €  which produced another dead silence .
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into her head .
â € œIf I eat one of these cakes , â €  she thought , â € œitâ € ™ s sure to make _ some _ change in my size ; and as it canâ € ™ t possibly make me larger , it must make me smaller , I suppose.â €  So she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly .
As soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside .
The poor little Lizard , Bill , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea-pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle .
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .
â € œThe first thing Iâ € ™ ve got to do , â €  said Alice to herself , as she wandered about in the wood , â € œis to grow to my right size again ; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden .
I think that will be the best plan.â €  It sounded an excellent plan , no doubt , and very neatly and simply arranged ; the only difficulty was , that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it ; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees , a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry .
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her .
â € œPoor little thing ! â €  said Alice , in a coaxing tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing .
Hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and held it out to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , with a yelp of delight , and rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ; and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut .
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape ; so she set off at once , and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath , and till the puppyâ € ™ s bark sounded quite faint in the distance .
â € œAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was ! â €  said Alice , as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself , and fanned herself with one of the leaves : â € œI should have liked teaching it tricks very much , ifâ € ” if Iâ € ™ d only been the right size to do it !
Oh dear !
Iâ € ™ d nearly forgotten that Iâ € ™ ve got to grow up again !
Let me seeâ € ” how _ is _ it to be managed ?
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ? â €  The great question certainly was , what ?
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances .
There was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .
She stretched herself up on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .
CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice .
â € œWho are _ you ? _ â €  said the Caterpillar .
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation .
Alice replied , rather shyly , â € œIâ € ” I hardly know , sir , just at presentâ € ” at least I know who I _ was _ when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then.â €  â € œWhat do you mean by that ? â €  said the Caterpillar sternly .
â € œExplain yourself ! â €  â € œI canâ € ™ t explain _ myself _ , Iâ € ™ m afraid , sir , â €  said Alice , â € œbecause Iâ € ™ m not myself , you see.â €  â € œI donâ € ™ t see , â €  said the Caterpillar .
â € œIâ € ™ m afraid I canâ € ™ t put it more clearly , â €  Alice replied very politely , â € œfor I canâ € ™ t understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.â €  â € œIt isnâ € ™ t , â €  said the Caterpillar .
â € œWell , perhaps you havenâ € ™ t found it so yet , â €  said Alice ; â € œbut when you have to turn into a chrysalisâ € ” you will some day , you knowâ € ” and then after that into a butterfly , I should think youâ € ™ ll feel it a little queer , wonâ € ™ t you ? â €  â € œNot a bit , â €  said the Caterpillar .
â € œWell , perhaps your feelings may be different , â €  said Alice ; â € œall I know is , it would feel very queer to _ me _ .â €  â € œYou ! â €  said the Caterpillar contemptuously .
â € œWho are _ you ? _ â €  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation .
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillarâ € ™ s making such _ very _ short remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , â € œI think , you ought to tell me who _ you _ are , first.â €  â € œWhy ? â €  said the Caterpillar .
Here was another puzzling question ; and as Alice could not think of any good reason , and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _ very _ unpleasant state of mind , she turned away .
â € œCome back ! â €  the Caterpillar called after her .
â € œIâ € ™ ve something important to say ! â €  This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again .
â € œKeep your temper , â €  said the Caterpillar .
â € œIs that all ? â €  said Alice , swallowing down her anger as well as she could .
â € œNo , â €  said the Caterpillar .
Alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing .
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , â € œSo you think youâ € ™ re changed , do you ? â €  â € œIâ € ™ m afraid I am , sir , â €  said Alice ; â € œI canâ € ™ t remember things as I usedâ € ” and I donâ € ™ t keep the same size for ten minutes together ! â €  â € œCanâ € ™ t remember _ what _ things ? â €  said the Caterpillar .
â € œWell , Iâ € ™ ve tried to say â € œHow doth the little busy bee , â €  but it all came different ! â €  Alice replied in a very melancholy voice .
â € œRepeat , â € œ _ You are old , Father William _ , â € ™ â €  said the Caterpillar .
Alice folded her hands , and began : â € ” â € œYou are old , Father William , â €  the young man said , â € œAnd your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your headâ € ” Do you think , at your age , it is right ? â €  â € œIn my youth , â €  Father William replied to his son , â € œI feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that Iâ € ™ m perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again.â €  â € œYou are old , â €  said the youth , â € œas I mentioned before , And have grown most uncommonly fat ; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the doorâ € ” Pray , what is the reason of that ? â €  â € œIn my youth , â €  said the sage , as he shook his grey locks , â € œI kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointmentâ € ” one shilling the boxâ € ” Allow me to sell you a couple ? â €  â € œYou are old , â €  said the youth , â € œand your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet ; Yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beakâ € ” Pray , how did you manage to do it ? â €  â € œIn my youth , â €  said his father , â € œI took to the law , And argued each case with my wife ; And the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , Has lasted the rest of my life.â €  â € œYou are old , â €  said the youth , â € œone would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseâ € ” What made you so awfully clever ? â €  â € œI have answered three questions , and that is enough , â €  Said his father ; â € œdonâ € ™ t give yourself airs !
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ?
Be off , or Iâ € ™ ll kick you down stairs ! â €  â € œThat is not said right , â €  said the Caterpillar .
â € œNot _ quite _ right , Iâ € ™ m afraid , â €  said Alice , timidly ; â € œsome of the words have got altered.â €  â € œIt is wrong from beginning to end , â €  said the Caterpillar decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes .
The Caterpillar was the first to speak .
â € œWhat size do you want to be ? â €  it asked .
â € œOh , Iâ € ™ m not particular as to size , â €  Alice hastily replied ; â € œonly one doesnâ € ™ t like changing so often , you know.â €  â € œI _ donâ € ™ t _ know , â €  said the Caterpillar .
Alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before , and she felt that she was losing her temper .
â € œAre you content now ? â €  said the Caterpillar .
â € œWell , I should like to be a _ little _ larger , sir , if you wouldnâ € ™ t mind , â €  said Alice : â € œthree inches is such a wretched height to be.â €  â € œIt is a very good height indeed ! â €  said the Caterpillar angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) .
â € œBut Iâ € ™ m not used to it ! â €  pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone .
And she thought of herself , â € œI wish the creatures wouldnâ € ™ t be so easily offended ! â €  â € œYouâ € ™ ll get used to it in time , â €  said the Caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again .
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again .
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself .
Then it got down off the mushroom , and crawled away in the grass , merely remarking as it went , â € œOne side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter.â €  â € œOne side of _ what ? _ The other side of _ what ? _ â €  thought Alice to herself .
â € œOf the mushroom , â €  said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight .
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and as it was perfectly round , she found this a very difficult question .
However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand .
â € œAnd now which is which ? â €  she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot !
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit .
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * â € œCome , my headâ € ™ s free at last ! â €  said Alice in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .
â € œWhat _ can _ all that green stuff be ? â €  said Alice .
â € œAnd where _ have _ my shoulders got to ?
And oh , my poor hands , how is it I canâ € ™ t see you ? â €  She was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head , she tried to get her head down to them , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent .
She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings .
â € œSerpent ! â €  screamed the Pigeon .
â € œIâ € ™ m _ not _ a serpent ! â €  said Alice indignantly .
â € œLet me alone ! â €  â € œSerpent , I say again ! â €  repeated the Pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , â € œIâ € ™ ve tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them ! â €  â € œI havenâ € ™ t the least idea what youâ € ™ re talking about , â €  said Alice .
â € œIâ € ™ ve tried the roots of trees , and Iâ € ™ ve tried banks , and Iâ € ™ ve tried hedges , â €  the Pigeon went on , without attending to her ; â € œbut those serpents !
Thereâ € ™ s no pleasing them ! â €  Alice was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished .
â € œAs if it wasnâ € ™ t trouble enough hatching the eggs , â €  said the Pigeon ; â € œbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day !
Why , I havenâ € ™ t had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! â €  â € œIâ € ™ m very sorry youâ € ™ ve been annoyed , â €  said Alice , who was beginning to see its meaning .
â € œAnd just as Iâ € ™ d taken the highest tree in the wood , â €  continued the Pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek , â € œand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky !
Ugh , Serpent ! â €  â € œBut Iâ € ™ m _ not _ a serpent , I tell you ! â €  said Alice .
â € œIâ € ™ m aâ € ” Iâ € ™ m aâ € ” â €  â € œWell !
_ What _ are you ? â €  said the Pigeon .
â € œI can see youâ € ™ re trying to invent something ! â €  â € œIâ € ” Iâ € ™ m a little girl , â €  said Alice , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day .
â € œA likely story indeed ! â €  said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt .
â € œIâ € ™ ve seen a good many little girls in my time , but never _ one _ with such a neck as that !
No , no !
Youâ € ™ re a serpent ; and thereâ € ™ s no use denying it .
I suppose youâ € ™ ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! â €  â € œI _ have _ tasted eggs , certainly , â €  said Alice , who was a very truthful child ; â € œbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know.â €  â € œI donâ € ™ t believe it , â €  said the Pigeon ; â € œbut if they do , why then theyâ € ™ re a kind of serpent , thatâ € ™ s all I can say.â €  This was such a new idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding , â € œYouâ € ™ re looking for eggs , I know _ that _ well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether youâ € ™ re a little girl or a serpent ? â €  â € œIt matters a good deal to _ me _ , â €  said Alice hastily ; â € œbut Iâ € ™ m not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I shouldnâ € ™ t want _ yours _ : I donâ € ™ t like them raw.â €  â € œWell , be off , then ! â €  said the Pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest .
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it .
After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height .
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size , that it felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in a few minutes , and began talking to herself , as usual .
â € œCome , thereâ € ™ s half my plan done now !
How puzzling all these changes are !
Iâ € ™ m never sure what Iâ € ™ m going to be , from one minute to another !
However , Iâ € ™ ve got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful gardenâ € ” how _ is _ that to be done , I wonder ? â €  As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high .
â € œWhoever lives there , â €  thought Alice , â € œitâ € ™ ll never do to come upon them _ this _ size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! â €  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high .
CHAPTER VI .
Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house , and wondering what to do next , when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodâ € ” ( she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery : otherwise , judging by his face only , she would have called him a fish ) â € ” and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles .
It was opened by another footman in livery , with a round face , and large eyes like a frog ; and both footmen , Alice noticed , had powdered hair that curled all over their heads .
She felt very curious to know what it was all about , and crept a little way out of the wood to listen .
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter , nearly as large as himself , and this he handed over to the other , saying , in a solemn tone , â € œFor the Duchess .
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.â €  The Frog-Footman repeated , in the same solemn tone , only changing the order of the words a little , â € œFrom the Queen .
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.â €  Then they both bowed low , and their curls got entangled together .
Alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .
Alice went timidly up to the door , and knocked .
â € œThereâ € ™ s no sort of use in knocking , â €  said the Footman , â € œand that for two reasons .
First , because Iâ € ™ m on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because theyâ € ™ re making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you.â €  And certainly there _ was _ a most extraordinary noise going on withinâ € ” a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces .
â € œPlease , then , â €  said Alice , â € œhow am I to get in ? â €  â € œThere might be some sense in your knocking , â €  the Footman went on without attending to her , â € œif we had the door between us .
For instance , if you were _ inside _ , you might knock , and I could let you out , you know.â €  He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking , and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil .
â € œBut perhaps he canâ € ™ t help it , â €  she said to herself ; â € œhis eyes are so _ very _ nearly at the top of his head .
But at any rate he might answer questions.â € ” How am I to get in ? â €  she repeated , aloud .
â € œI shall sit here , â €  the Footman remarked , â € œtill tomorrowâ € ” â €  At this moment the door of the house opened , and a large plate came skimming out , straight at the Footmanâ € ™ s head : it just grazed his nose , and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him .
â € œâ € ” or next day , maybe , â €  the Footman continued in the same tone , exactly as if nothing had happened .
â € œHow am I to get in ? â €  asked Alice again , in a louder tone .
â € œ _ Are _ you to get in at all ? â €  said the Footman .
â € œThatâ € ™ s the first question , you know.â €  It was , no doubt : only Alice did not like to be told so .
â € œItâ € ™ s really dreadful , â €  she muttered to herself , â € œthe way all the creatures argue .
Itâ € ™ s enough to drive one crazy ! â €  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark , with variations .
â € œI shall sit here , â €  he said , â € œon and off , for days and days.â €  â € œBut what am _ I _ to do ? â €  said Alice .
â € œAnything you like , â €  said the Footman , and began whistling .
â € œOh , thereâ € ™ s no use in talking to him , â €  said Alice desperately : â € œheâ € ™ s perfectly idiotic ! â €  And she opened the door and went in .
The door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other : the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup .
â € œThereâ € ™ s certainly too much pepper in that soup ! â €  Alice said to herself , as well as she could for sneezing .
There was certainly too much of it in the air .
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a momentâ € ™ s pause .
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .
â € œPlease would you tell me , â €  said Alice , a little timidly , for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first , â € œwhy your cat grins like that ? â €  â € œItâ € ™ s a Cheshire cat , â €  said the Duchess , â € œand thatâ € ™ s why .
Pig ! â €  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby , and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again : â € ” â € œI didnâ € ™ t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I didnâ € ™ t know that cats _ could _ grin.â €  â € œThey all can , â €  said the Duchess ; â € œand most of â € ™ em do.â €  â € œI donâ € ™ t know of any that do , â €  Alice said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation .
â € œYou donâ € ™ t know much , â €  said the Duchess ; â € œand thatâ € ™ s a fact.â €  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark , and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation .
While she was trying to fix on one , the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire , and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the babyâ € ” the fire-irons came first ; then followed a shower of saucepans , plates , and dishes .
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .
â € œOh , _ please _ mind what youâ € ™ re doing ! â €  cried Alice , jumping up and down in an agony of terror .
â € œOh , there goes his _ precious _ nose ! â €  as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it , and very nearly carried it off .
â € œIf everybody minded their own business , â €  the Duchess said in a hoarse growl , â € œthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.â €  â € œWhich would _ not _ be an advantage , â €  said Alice , who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge .
â € œJust think of what work it would make with the day and night !
You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axisâ € ” â €  â € œTalking of axes , â €  said the Duchess , â € œchop off her head ! â €  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : â € œTwenty-four hours , I _ think _ ; or is it twelve ?
Iâ € ” â €  â € œOh , donâ € ™ t bother _ me _ , â €  said the Duchess ; â € œI never could abide figures ! â €  And with that she began nursing her child again , singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so , and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line : â € œSpeak roughly to your little boy , And beat him when he sneezes : He only does it to annoy , Because he knows it teases.â €  CHORUS .
( In which the cook and the baby joined ) : â € œWow !
wow !
wow ! â €  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song , she kept tossing the baby violently up and down , and the poor little thing howled so , that Alice could hardly hear the words : â € ” â € œI speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes ; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases ! â €  CHORUS .
â € œWow !
wow !
wow ! â €  â € œHere !
you may nurse it a bit , if you like ! â €  the Duchess said to Alice , flinging the baby at her as she spoke .
â € œI must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen , â €  and she hurried out of the room .
The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out , but it just missed her .
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer-shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , â € œjust like a star-fish , â €  thought Alice .
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it , ( which was to twist it up into a sort of knot , and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself , ) she carried it out into the open air .
â € œIf I donâ € ™ t take this child away with me , â €  thought Alice , â € œtheyâ € ™ re sure to kill it in a day or two : wouldnâ € ™ t it be murder to leave it behind ? â €  She said the last words out loud , and the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ) .
â € œDonâ € ™ t grunt , â €  said Alice ; â € œthatâ € ™ s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.â €  The baby grunted again , and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it .
There could be no doubt that it had a _ very _ turn-up nose , much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby : altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all .
â € œBut perhaps it was only sobbing , â €  she thought , and looked into its eyes again , to see if there were any tears .
